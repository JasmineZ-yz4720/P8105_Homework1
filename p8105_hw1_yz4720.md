# Question 1

``` r
help(early_january_weather)
```

The dataset “early_january_weather” contains hourly weather data for
LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. There are 15 variables:
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. The size of the
dataset is 358 rows by 15 columns. The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

``` r
scatterplot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
scatterplot
```

``` r
ggsave(scatterplot, file="scatterplot_question1.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

From the scatterplot, it can be noticed that temperature fluctuates
during each day (increases during the day and decreases during the
night). The overall temperature increases as days progress in January.
In addition, it rained for the period around Jan 10th to 14th because
the humidity increased a lot.

# Question 2

## Create the dataframe

``` r
q2_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  samp_pos = samp > 0,
  samp_char = c("My", "name", "is", "Jasmine", "Zhang", "and", "I", "am", "from", "Shanghai"),
  samp_fac = factor(c("head", "tail", "head", "neither","tail", "neither", "tail", "tail", "neither","tail"))
)
q2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##      samp samp_pos samp_char samp_fac
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>    <chr>     <fct>   
    ##  1 -1.39  FALSE    My        head    
    ##  2 -0.125 FALSE    name      tail    
    ##  3  0.762 TRUE     is        head    
    ##  4  1.38  TRUE     Jasmine   neither 
    ##  5 -1.03  FALSE    Zhang     tail    
    ##  6  0.378 TRUE     and       neither 
    ##  7 -0.405 FALSE    I         tail    
    ##  8 -0.558 FALSE    am        tail    
    ##  9  0.106 TRUE     from      neither 
    ## 10 -0.184 FALSE    Shanghai  tail

## Taking mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.1073381

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, samp_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, samp_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When taking the mean of each variable, it works for the random sample
from a standard Normal distribution and the logical vector. It doesn’t
work for the character and factor vectors.

## Converting variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_char))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_fac))
```

When trying to convert the logical, character, and factor variables to
numeric variable, it works for logical variable (by converting FALSE to
0 and TRUE to 1), and factor variable (by assigning 1, 2, 3 to the three
levels of factor respectively). The conversion doesn’t work for the
character variable. This explains that taking the mean of a logical
variable was successful. But the mean function can only be applied to
numeric or logical variables but not factor variable.
