# Question 1

``` r
help(early_january_weather)
```

In the dataset “early_january_weather”, the variables are origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. The size of the dataset is 358
rows by 15 columns. The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

``` r
scatterplot<- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
scatterplot
```

``` r
ggsave(scatterplot, file="scatterplot_question1.pdf")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

From the scatterplot, it can be noticed that temperature fluctuates
during each day (increases during the day and decreases during the
night). The overall temperature increases as days pass progress in
January. In addition, it rained for the period around Jan 10th to 14th
because the humidity increased a lot.

# Question 2

## Create the dataframe

``` r
q2_df = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  samp_pos = samp > 0,
  samp_char = c("My","name","is","Jasmine","Zhang","and","I","am","from","Shanghai"),
  samp_fac = factor(c("head", "tail", "head", "neither","tail", "neither", "tail", "tail", "neither","tail"))
)
q2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##      samp samp_pos samp_char samp_fac
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>    <chr>     <fct>   
    ##  1  0.867 TRUE     My        head    
    ##  2 -0.866 FALSE    name      tail    
    ##  3  0.391 TRUE     is        head    
    ##  4 -0.403 FALSE    Jasmine   neither 
    ##  5 -0.626 FALSE    Zhang     tail    
    ##  6 -0.233 FALSE    and       neither 
    ##  7 -0.736 FALSE    I         tail    
    ##  8 -0.406 FALSE    am        tail    
    ##  9 -2.71  FALSE    from      neither 
    ## 10  0.627 TRUE     Shanghai  tail

## Taking mean of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4092748

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, samp_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, samp_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, samp_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When taking the mean of each variable, it works for the random sample
from a standard Normal distribution and the logical vector. It doesn’t
work for the character and factor vectors.

## Converting variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_char))
as.numeric(pull(q2_df, samp_fac))
```

When trying to convert the logical, character, and factor variables to
numeric variable, it works for logical variable (by converting FALSE to
0 and TRUE to 1), and factor variable (by assigning 1, 2, 3 to the three
levels of factor respectively). The conversion doesn’t work for the
character variable. This explains that taking the mean of a logical
variable was successful. But the mean function can only be applied to
numeric or logical but not factor.
